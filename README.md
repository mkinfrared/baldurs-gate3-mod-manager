# Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager macOS

In pursuit of a more personalized and enjoyable gaming experience, many gamers turn towards mods to tailor their experience to their unique preferences. However, for macOS users playing Baldur's Gate 3, managing these mods was a daunting task due to the lack of a suitable mod manager. This inconvenience impelled the creation of the Mod Manager. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/mkinfrared/baldurs-gate3-mod-manager/releases).

## Installation

Installation

Step 1: [Download](https://github.com/mkinfrared/baldurs-gate3-mod-manager/releases/latest) and Install Download the application.
Step 2: Go to your Applications folder, find the installed app, and try to open it. You'll likely get a security warning that the app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer (I am not enrolled in Apple Developer Program).
Step 3: Use the following steps to bypass this security warning:

1. Open System Preferences
2. Click on Security & Privacy
3. At the bottom of the window, you will see a message "baldurs-gate3-mod-manager- was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer." Click on Open Anyway.

Step 4: Open the Application

## Features and Usage

**Mod Installation**: The application facilitates easy mod installation. Simply `drag & drop` the `zip`, `rar` or `7z` file into the application window or use a button select files via a dialog window, click `Install`, and you have your mod installed.

**Mod Support**: The application only supports mods installed in the `Mods` folder and does not support mods that require placement in the game's main directory. For now, only the default `Mods` directory (`Documents/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Mods`) is supported.

**Mod Deletion**: The tool gives you the ability to delete previously installed mods entirely from your computer, just make sure you installed the mods using the manager. Mods installed manually are not supported for deletion.

**Mod Order**: You can drag mods in `Mod Order` list to change their order. Please note, that you can only drag mods which contain `info.json` file.
